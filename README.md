# SkiaPlatformer – 2-Hour Skia Platformer Prototype 😝   
   
A simple 2D platformer prototype built entirely with **Skia** (FMX + Skia4Delphi)    
   
### What's inside    
- Stickman character with real physics (gravity, jumping, friction, acceleration)     
- Jumping on blocks (basic collision detection)    
- Left/right movement + jump with keyboard (A/D or Left/Right arrows + Space/Up)    
- Nice gradient sky background + rounded, shadowed blocks with glow     
- Animated avatar (slight sway & breathing bounce when jumping, directional facing)     
    
No game engine, no external renderer – **pure Skia canvas** + hand-written physics.   
    
### Controls   
- **A / Left Arrow** → Move left     
- **D / Right Arrow** → Move right     
- **Space / Up Arrow** → Jump     
   
For now: **Proof of concept** – built from scratch in 2 hours.

Happy jumping! 🦘
