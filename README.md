# Skia Platformer Prototype 

[![Ask DeepWiki](https://deepwiki.com/badge.svg)](https://deepwiki.com/LaMitaOne/Skia_PlatformerGame)
   
A simple 2D platformer prototype built entirely with **Skia** (FMX + Skia4Delphi)    
Just a quick idea i had to try in 2 hours :D and yea works    

Sample Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZmmeK92jpQ           
   
### What's inside    
- Stickman character with real physics (gravity, jumping, friction, acceleration)     
- Jumping on blocks (basic collision detection)    
- Left/right movement + jump with keyboard (Left/Right arrows + Up)    
- Nice gradient sky background + rounded, shadowed blocks with glow     
- Animated avatar (slight sway & breathing bounce when jumping, directional facing)     
    
No game engine. No external renderer.    
Just **pure Skia canvas** and hand-written physics.    
     
This project is a minimal but robust "skeleton" for a 2D platformer. It provides everything you need to get started—gravity, friction, collisions, and particle effects—without the complexity of a massive engine. It’s the perfect starting point to see exactly how the mechanics work under the hood. All in just a few hundred lines.          
    
### Controls   
- **Left Arrow** → Move left     
- **Right Arrow** → Move right     
- **Up Arrow** → Jump     
   
For now: **Proof of concept** – built from scratch in 2 hours.

Happy jumping! 🦘
